I have been a tour guide, a terrible waitress and a childrenâ€™s party entertainer. I went to university in Bristol, a hub for the arts, and was a member of an improvised comedy variety show called The Bish Bosh Bash. We once improvised a musical about courgettes falling in love, a true highlight in my improvising career.
