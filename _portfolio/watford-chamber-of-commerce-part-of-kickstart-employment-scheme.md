Young people need a helping hand to kickstart their adult working lives maybe more now than ever. They often don’t have access to positive work experiences, while employers can be hesitant to hire them because they lack expertise.

Watford and West Herts Chamber of Commerce can provide a way to help 16 to 24-year-olds, who are trying to get on the employment ladder during this challenging period when many businesses are struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Chamber is an approved gateway for the government's Kickstart scheme, with the aim of assisting local businesses and the young people of Watford. Essentially, the government will fund young workers on Universal Credit for up to 25 hours a week of work for the first six months.

Many businesses from Hertfordshire and beyond are currently involved in the initiative and the Chamber is keen to help you, too.

It will provide training and other help to support the Kickstarters and their employers, with a central goal of creating a positive impact, developing transferable skills and supporting long-term, sustainable employment.

There's a real focus on encouraging businesses to help young people in the most meaningful way possible. The personal development programme for Kickstart includes networking, community projects, corporate social responsibility, positive intelligence and mental health first aid and wellbeing.

The Chamber’s commitment to community engagement has had a huge impact on Watford-based charity Electric Umbrella, which “challenges the perception about people with learning disabilities and enriches and empowers lives through music”.

Chief executive Mel Boda said: “The connection to businesses has been amazing, we've done shows for Warner Brothers, the Hilton, and last week we did a virtual gig for VWV's big pharmaceutical conference. We opened the event with an energiser and performed every 90 minutes or so.

“There were around 200 delegates who came from different organisations, loads of them contacted us asking if Electric Umbrella could do something similar for them, too.

“I'd say that collaboration makes the world go round, there is always something we can do together even if the link doesn't seem obvious at first. The Chamber has been amazing for that'.
