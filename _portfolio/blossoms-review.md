Whilst many of us have taken to baking banana bread, redecorating and binge-watching quite literally everything on Netflix, Blossoms have used their time in isolation to record covers. Their latest track transports you straight to summer with its chill vibes and calming tone. Blossoms called upon Liam Fray (lead singer of The Courteeners) to accompany them with a cover of his 2008 track ‘Please Don’t’.

The original ‘Please Don’t’ included rattling snare drums and staccato guitar strums, but Blossoms have stripped the tune right back to its core. Together, Blossoms and Fray have created a far more mature sound. The harmonies between Fray and Tom Ogden add a whole new layer to the song that evolves from the original. The stop-start invective in the lyrics is less jarring in this cover, most likely due to Ogden’s smoky tone. The trickle of the piano, rhythmic guitar riffs, whisper-like singing, and steady drumbeats all blend seamlessly together, marrying the best of Liam Fray and Blossoms.

‘Please Don’t (In Isolation)’ is not the most unique track around, but it is undeniably catchy, and we will undoubtedly have it on repeat all summer.
